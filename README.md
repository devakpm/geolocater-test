# Image Geolocator Neural Network

A deep learning model that predicts the geographical location where an image was taken based on its visual content.

## Overview

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the location where a photo was taken based on visual features like architecture, landscapes, vegetation, and other geographical indicators.

## Features

- Image location prediction with latitude and longitude coordinates
- Support for various image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Pre-trained model for quick inference
- Training pipeline for custom datasets
- Visualization of predictions on a map

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- Pillow
- pandas
- folium (for visualization)
- tqdm

## Installation
